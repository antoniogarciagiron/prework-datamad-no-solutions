    "# Robin Hood\n",

    "![](images/arrows.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "In this challenge, the landing position of arrows shot by archers in the competition will be represented using 2-dimensional coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the 2-dimensional space, a point can be defined by a pair of values that correspond to the horizontal coordinate (x) and the vertical coordinate (y). For example, in our case, an arrow that hits the center of the archery target will land in position (0, 0) on the coordinate axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The space can be divided into 4 zones (quadrants): Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. If a point is in Q1, both its x coordinate and y coordinate are positive. Any point with a null x or y coordinate is considered to not belong to any quadrant. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about the cartesian coordinate system, you can check this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "You don't necessarily need to use all the tools. Maybe you opt to use some of them or completely different ones, they are given to help you shape the exercise. Programming exercises can be solved in many different ways.\n",
    "* Data structures: **lists, sets, tuples**\n",
